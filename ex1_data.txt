Back through the years, I go wondering once again,
Back to the seasons of my youth,
I recall a box of rags someone gave us,
And how my mama put the rags to use,
They were rags of many colours,
Every piece was small,
I didn't have a coat,
And it was way down in the fall,
Mama put the rags together,
Sewing every piece with love,
She made my coat of many colours that I was so proud of,
As she sewed,
She told a story, 
From the Bible she had read,
About the coat of many colours,
Joseph wore,
And then she said,
Perhaps this coat will bring you,
Goodluck and happiness,
And I just couldn't wait to wear it,
As mama blessed it with a kiss,

My coat of many colours that my mama made for me,
Made only from rags but I wore it so proudly,
Although we had no money but I was rich as I could be,
In my coat of many colours my mama made for me.
